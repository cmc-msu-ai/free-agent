-- | An @Agent t f a@ is a program which uses functor @f@ as a low-level
-- API, monad transformer @t@ â€” for high-level features and which returns
-- a value of type @a@.
--
-- The important thing is that the environment may mess with @t@ on
-- initialization of the agent or on low-level API calls. This was designed
-- for the possibility of `behaviosites' (see
-- http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.114.4071 for
-- more details).
